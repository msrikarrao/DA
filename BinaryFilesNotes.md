### WORKING WITH BINARY FILES
- We can use methods of the `pickle` module to work with binary files.
- It can be used to dump (write) an object like a list to a file and to load (read) an object like a list from a binary file.

### Two methods of the pickle module
- dump(object, bfile)
    - Writes the specified object to the binary file.
- load(bfile)
    - Reads the object from the binary file.
